Fill is a basic color matching game ported from previous implementations in
JavaScript and C.

The purpose of this game is to familiarize myself with some basic Java
development concepts; implement some basic gaming elements; have a little fun
with some basic pixel art; and finally, to convince myself that I can create
things rather than always just consuming them.

Command to build Jar file:

$ jar -cvfe fill-0.1.jar cglosser.Main resources/ -C build/ .

Command to run Jar file:

$ java -jar fill-0.1.jar
