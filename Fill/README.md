Fill is a basic color matching game ported from previous implementations in
JavaScript and C.

The purpose of this game is to familiarize myself with some basic Java
development concepts; implement some basic gaming elements; have a little fun
with some basic pixel art; and finally, to convince myself that I can create
things rather than always just consuming them.
