======

Built most of the components of Pong in the Thread Playground, so I copied it
here, and starting a basic Pong implementation.

Command to build Jar file:

$ jar -cvfe pong-0.1.jar cglosser.Main resources/ -C build/ .

Command to run Jar file:

$ java -jar pong-0.1.jar

Should just work by using ant build:  ant jardist
