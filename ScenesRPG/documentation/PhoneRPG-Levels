There was a simple iPhone RPG I was playing that was pretty simple.  Thinking
about what I've been learning here, this could definitely be reproduced with
the simple "menuing" level loading functionality I've already learned.

"Town" menu with buttons for
- "Mission-giver-1"
- "Mission-giver-2"
- "Inn"
- "Equipment"
- "Leave"

Then, "Inn" will be the same from town to town, but the price would change.
"Equipment" will be sword + 1, 2, 3, etc.  Mission givers will be all that
noticeably changes, from town to town.  That's where story gets written.

"Leave" is what will take you out to handle mission objectives.  Leave would
provide options like "haunted forest", "grassy plains", etc.  Could even just
build a list of adjectives and locations (forest, plains, mountains, etc).

Would still need an XP system, Beastiery, weapon / armor system.  Come up with
locations, missions, stories.
