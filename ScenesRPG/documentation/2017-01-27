So, I'd like to do this as the next step.  I Think it would be a good next
level in my game development.  But I'm running into more questions about
whether I'm really using the right tools, again.  Java just doesn't seem to be
easy to package and publish anywhere.  I could start using GameMaker to start
writing actual games that I find interesting / compelling, and pushing them out
to the itch.io site, just to start going through that process...  Good side
note, I suppose.  Also, noteworthy... Game Maker is only available for Windows.

And writing Java code for Android is fun, but I can't really do it from my Mac
here, while I'm just chilling.

I think I'm letting myself get distracted.  What I need to do is go get a pad
and paper, and start drawing these things out.

Basically, what we need here is a good screen management system.  We started
work on that with the Fill game, where we created a Welcome, Game, Win, and
Lose screens, and loaded them in succession based on button presses.

That basic skeleton would work here, as well.  So, a basic screen manager, and
some buttons to let me click through We'd need:

Welcome Screen
==============

Start -> Town Screen
Quit -> Exit

Town Screen
===========

Inn -> In Screen
Quest1 -> Quest Screen
Quest2 -> Quest Screen
Adventure -> Adventure screen
Shop -> Shop screen
Quit -> Exit

Inn
===

Sleep -> Town Screen
Leave -> Town Screen

Quest Screen
============

Accept -> Town Screen
Decline -> Town Screen

Adventure Screen
================

Fight -> Adventure Screen
Return to town -> Town Screen

Shop Screen
===========

Purchase -> Purchase Screen
Sell -> Sell Screen
Exit -> Town Screen


That would provide me the skeleton of this game, and would require little work
that requires trememndous thinking to expand on what I already have for the
Fill game.

From there, I could go a ton of directions, but that's a good start.
