ScenesRPG is a basic project to help me build out my toolkit.  It will consist
of typical game menu screens, and then progress to slightly more complicated
screens that include basic game mechanics (e.g. shops, inns, etc).

The purpose of this game is to help me investigate approaches to creating
screen management systems.  The project will attempt to introduce some basic RPG
elements, but will primarily focus on how to present the user with meaningful
menuing and display systems with which they can easily interact.

Command to build Jar file:
