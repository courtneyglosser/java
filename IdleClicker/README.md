Working in the Thread playground, it very quickly started turning into a game
inspired by all the Idle games that I've been playing on Kongregate.

This is fine, but I quickly found my todo list to be about expanding the Idle
game's capabilities and the thread management had become entrenched.  So, this
is a new project to handle the IdleClicker game content that I had started.

Command to build Jar file:

$ jar -cvfe IdleClicker-0.1.jar cglosser.Main resources/ -C build/ .

Command to run Jar file:

$ java -jar IdleClicker-0.1.jar

Should just work by using ant build:  ant jardist
